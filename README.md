# Forecasting Console Games Sales With Regression Model

Build a regression model to forecast console games sales

__Project Description:__

Critic score has always been one of the main factor for consumers to make decision whether to purchase the game or not. My assumption is that it heavily affects the sales performance of each games. If my assumption is true, it would be very beneficial for video games publishers if they could forecast the sales by using critic score.

In this project, we will explore the relationship of sales and critic score, along with other factors e.g. genre, platform. We will focus only on 8th generation console games (i.e. PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch). Finally, we will build a regression model to predict sales performance based on these factors.
